# MongoDB References

This project was to explore MongoDB references


### Cases to use References

In the following example we can see that the publisher information is being repeated over and over again.

```
{
   title: "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
   author: [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
   published_date: ISODate("2010-09-24"),
   pages: 216,
   language: "English",
   publisher: {
              name: "O'Reilly Media",
              founded: 1980,
              location: "CA"
            }
}

{
   title: "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
   author: "Kristina Chodorow",
   published_date: ISODate("2011-05-06"),
   pages: 68,
   language: "English",
   publisher: {
              name: "O'Reilly Media",
              founded: 1980,
              location: "CA"
            }
}
```

To avoid repetition of publisher data we use references to keep the publisher information in a seperate collection and have a link connecting both these collections.

```
{
   name: "O'Reilly Media",
   founded: 1980,
   location: "CA",
   books: [123456789, 234567890, ...]
}

{
    _id: 123456789,
    title: "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
    author: [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
    published_date: ISODate("2010-09-24"),
    pages: 216,
    language: "English"
}

{
   _id: 234567890,
   title: "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
   author: "Kristina Chodorow",
   published_date: ISODate("2011-05-06"),
   pages: 68,
   language: "English"
}
```
